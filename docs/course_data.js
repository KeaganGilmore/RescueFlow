Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this module, you will:\n\n- Have a good idea of the NSRI Structure and be familiar with its History, Role, and Requirements.\n- Be familiar with the background knowledge needed to have a successful NSRI career.\n\n#### 2. History and Development of the NSRI\n\nIn 1966 at Stillbaai on the East coast, just below Mossel Bay, 17 fishermen drowned after three fishing boats sank in a terrible storm. A Miss Patty Price of Simon\u2019s Town wrote a letter to the Cape Argus and said that it was about time that a Sea Rescue Service was formed in South Africa. Captain John Payne, a member of the Society of Master Mariners, proposed at the annual conference that the Society attempt the formation of a rescue service.\n\nThe proposal was accepted, and a meeting of interested parties was called in Cape Town where a steering committee was formed. At the first meeting, two volunteers stepped forward as crewmen. They were Captain Bob Deacon and Ray Lunt, and the South African Inshore Rescue Service, as it was called, came into existence. The name was later changed to the National Sea Rescue Institute of South Africa and on the 29th May 1967, was officially registered as a non-profit organisation and recognised by the Department of Transport as a sea rescue service.\n\n![Capt.

The medical care that we provide extends this value to the people we rescue.\n- **Pride**: We are a proud organization. Proud of the service we deliver, proud of each other, and proud to be South African.\n- **Accountability**: We are accountable to the people we serve, for the service that we deliver, and to each other for support.\n- **Safety**: We value the safety of our crews and that of our patients above everything. And we don\u2019t compromise in ensuring their wellbeing at sea.\n\n#### 2.4 About Us\n\nWe are a registered NPC Company and Non-Profit Organisation (NPO) with the Department of Social Development, which delivers maritime rescue services along the coast and on inland navigable waters in South Africa.\n\nWe also deliver advocacy and preventative programs which target drowning, particularly in children.\n\nServices are delivered directly to the citizens of South Africa both in a rescue and educational context. Patients rescued include medical evacuations from the 12,000 ships that dock in South African ports every year, recreational boaters (sailors and ski-boaters), subsistence fisher folk, recreational kite boaters and windsurfers, and the formal fishing industry as well as bathers rescued from the surf.\n\nWe enjoy excellent working relationships with other emergency services around the country and we believe that it is through team effort that lives are saved.",

He is assisted by the staff at Head Office, which includes the Executive Directors of Operations (Mark Hughes), Finance (Mark Koning), and Executive Director Fundraising (Janine Van Stolk).\n\nThe key functions of Head Office are marketing, fundraising, budgeting, accounting, licensing, insurance, maintenance, procurement, training facilitation, and general administration, among other things. Only the staff employed at Head Office receive salaries.\n\nThe Operational Board determines and sets standards of infrastructure, boats, vehicles, equipment, safety, manning, and training. This Board meets every second month and is made up of operations board members and executive directors. The chairman sits on the governance board.\n\nOperational Board members are elected by station commanders and have a two-year term of office. The directors and crewmembers are all unpaid volunteers.\n\n#### 3.1 Regions\n\nStations are grouped into 7 regions, each with an Operations Board Member who answers to the operations director for the stations within his/her region.\n\n#### 4. Ways of Serving at Sea Rescue\n\n(See NSRI Career Path 2020 for more details)\n\n##### 4.1 Sea Rescue Water Safety Program\n\nThe Sea Rescue Water Safety Program is the educational initiative of Sea Rescue, with a vision to proactively prevent drowning tragedies in or near water. This program changes the lives of children by providing water safety lessons, teaching peer rescue, and basic CPR on school premises at no charge.\n\nAccording to the Medical Research Council, those most at risk of drowning are children from poor communities\u2014peri-urban and rural. The highest incidence of drowning is in freshwater, farm dams, and rivers, focusing on learners between the ages of 9 and 14.\n\nTo date, 2.7 million children have been taught water awareness, self-rescue, and basic CPR, with 81,976 taught in January and February of 2020 alone.",

This opportunity is ideal for those who wish to volunteer for Sea Rescue within their communities at specific times without participating in rescue boat operations.\n\nIf you are interested in joining a Survival Swimming Squad to teach children how to control their breathing, orientate themselves in water, float, and propel themselves to safety in a controlled environment, please contact us. We will provide the necessary training, manuals, equipment, command and control structures, and guidance on when and where to teach.\n\n#### 4.3 Pink Rescue Buoys\n\nFor those who wish to be involved with Sea Rescue but prefer not to go to sea and have only a few hours a week to spare, consider volunteering to manage the Pink Rescue Buoys in your area. If this is something you can help with, please email andrew@searescue.org.za. These emergency flotation devices have saved 56 lives so far, and we need your help to relieve the pressure on sea-going volunteers by managing the Pink Buoys in your area.\n\n#### 4.4 Coastwatchers\n\nCoastwatchers are trained in NSRI operational rescue procedures and serve as the \"eyes-on-call\" to assist or even initiate a rescue operation. Typically operating from home with a clear view of the sea (or dam/lake), their exact location is marked on the station chart as a waypoint. Their role is to report any flare sightings, distress signals, or situations where persons or vessels appear to be in distress to the NSRI emergency number.\n\nThe Station Commander or Coxswain of the responding NSRI station may contact Coastwatchers to observe and report on targets to assist during an operation. Each Coastwatcher is equipped with a pelorus direction indicator, which allows them to take an accurate bearing of the target. This information is passed to the ops room, where the sighting is plotted as a line on the chart from the Coastwatcher's position along the reported bearing. As more reports come in, the plotted bearings converge, providing a good indication of the target's location.\n\nInformation from Coastwatchers is crucial in identifying where the casualty is and where it is not, aiding in resource planning and reducing costs associated with abortive calls, wasted response time, sea time, and distances covered.",

This is achieved by encouraging supporters to leave a bequest or legacy to Sea Rescue in their Will, rather than making monthly payments from their retirement savings.\n\n#### Shore Crew\n\nThose who don\u2019t wish to go to sea or have reached the age limits can continue serving as shore crew. They can serve as rescue vehicle operators, base radio operators, plotters, and control room operators. Individuals with specialized knowledge who are willing to donate their expertise for maintenance, repairs, training, and administration are also welcome to join as shore crew. The term \"shore crew\" collectively refers to everyone who serves in a non-sea-going capacity.\n\n#### Sea Crew\n\nCrew members who meet the requirements, live within an appropriate travel time to the base, and have the flexibility in terms of work and available time on weekends to train and volunteer, can serve as sea-going crew.\n\n![Volunteer Sea-going crew during training](images/Intro_Course_Notes_-_HQ-2020_p9_img2.jpeg)",

However, they can still contribute through funding or services, such as rescue base maintenance, servicing equipment, and other organizational needs. Donors can invoice for services and donate the money back, allowing for BEE certificate and Tax letter provision. Donations are tax-deductible under Section 18A status. Corporate donors can earn BBB-EE scorecard points under the SED category, as more than 75% of beneficiaries are \"per definition black.\"\n\n#### Funding and Financial Matters\n\nThe NSRI raises funds through public subscriptions and volunteer services. Its income mainly comes from donations by companies, individuals, and trusts, with a small government grant (less than 2% of annual income). The 2018/19 operating budget was R96m, with income sources as follows:\n\n- Individual Donations: 62%\n- Fundraising Activity: 1%\n- Membership: 1%\n- Legacies: 2%\n- Investments: 0.6%\n- Government Funding: 2%\n\nThe NSRI operates in a challenging economic environment, relying on philanthropy from donors, with limited government funding. It provides a public service valued at over R200m annually to South Africans and tourists at a low taxpayer cost, supported by nearly 60,000 donors. The only similar service is the South African Lifesaving services, which are limited in scope.\n\nOperational costs are affected by fuel prices and foreign exchange rates, particularly for fuel and imported engines. Boats are locally manufactured, with R24m invested in the local boat building economy in 2019. The organization recovers VAT but has no other tax relief.",

Rescue Bases\n\nEach rescue base, often called a \u201cstation,\u201d is managed by a station commander, with support from a deputy station commander and a committee. These bases are established where there is a recognized need and a community of volunteers and supporters to facilitate their operation.\n\nThe committee is composed of senior station members, typically including the chief controller, station secretary/treasurer, station PRO, training/personnel officer, and appointed Coxswains.\n\nMonthly station committee meetings are generally followed by official crew meetings (business meetings) that allow all crewmembers to express their views and hear the ideas and opinions of others.\n\n#### 7. Selection of Crew\n\nThe Institute does not impose gender or racial restrictions in the selection or appointment of crew. However, the Organisation retains the right to appoint members based on acceptance criteria and their continued performance at the station as crew.\n\nNSRI crewmembers volunteer their services and do not receive payment or allowances. Crewmembers must indemnify NSRI against claims in the event of an accident.\n\nFor crewmembers under 18, parents or legal guardians must sign the indemnity. No one under 16 is allowed to join an NSRI station, and no one under 18 is permitted to participate in sea rescue operations.\n\nThe Station Commander has the final say on whether a Coxswain or crewperson may proceed to sea on active duty.\n\n##### 7.1 Insurance Policy\n\nThe NSRI has an insurance policy covering accidental injury or death for volunteers on duty or commuting to duty. \"Duty\" includes NSRI-related meetings, maintenance work parties, training, and rescue operations on land and in water.\n\nThe accidental death benefit is currently R1 million.\n\nThe policy covers up to R100,000 for medical treatment per volunteer per incident. It may also provide partial payouts for loss of earnings and disability, depending on the disability's nature.\n\nIf an injured person has their own medical cover, the NSRI\u2019s insurance will only activate once this cover is exhausted. If a volunteer depletes their personal medical aid benefits due to an \u201cinjury on NSRI duty\u201d claim and insufficient funds remain to cover further expenses, the NSRI\u2019s insurance will step in.",

If a volunteer has a medical aid or hospital plan, the NSRI will supplement their fund to cover the maximum claim amount for injuries sustained during NSRI duty. For those without such plans, the Station Commander or duty coxswain must contact an Executive Director or the EOC for hospital admittance authorization. Private hospital treatment is covered up to R100,000, and additional costs at state hospitals are covered by the NSRI.\n\nTo ensure the safety and fitness of its crew, the NSRI requires all crewpersons to be medically and physically fit for rescue missions. Volunteers must undergo a medical examination upon joining and at regular intervals. This requirement is crucial for the safety of the crew and compliance with underwriter conditions. Insurance claims may be denied if the claimant lacks a valid medical certificate or is outside the acceptable age range.\n\nShore Crew, who are non-seagoing members, must also have an NSRI medical examination upon joining and every five years thereafter. The NSRI medical form includes a provision for color vision testing, particularly for the green and red spectrum. This is important for those who may wish to apply for a day/night Coxswain certificate, as SAMSA regulations preclude individuals with certain color vision deficiencies.",

This involves the courage to \"call it in\" or \"turn back,\" as well as the consideration and wisdom to weigh the potential \"reward\" of a rescue against the risk to the vessel and crew. It also means having the correct attitude and value system of a volunteer rescuer. Volunteers should support the aims and visions of the institute and be aware that they are part of something bigger than themselves.\n\n- **Skill** encompasses both theoretical knowledge and practical ability. The theoretical aspect is covered by well-designed, relevant, and engaging manuals and online training courses. Practical ability is achieved through extensive and \"value-for-time\" sea-going training activities.\n\n- **Fitness** is essential. If one cannot save themselves, they pose a risk to themselves and their fellow crew. The institute requires measures to prevent willing but unable volunteers from becoming a risk to themselves and the crew they serve with.\n\nBeyond these factors, personal commitment and family support are the two most essential elements for a successful volunteer.\n\n---",

Current crew members are regularly evaluated to ensure they maintain these standards:\n\n- **Swim:** 200 meters in 10 minutes (2.5 minutes per 50m length in a pool). This is achievable for non-swimmers with training and effort. Must be completed without a lifejacket.\n  \n- **Tread Water:** 10 minutes. This can be done either wearing an NSRI wetsuit with hands on the head or without a wetsuit (hands can be placed anywhere). Must be performed without a lifejacket.\n  \n- **Water Exit:** Applicants must exit the water into their chosen class of vessel within one minute. No stepping on engine mounts or skegs is allowed. Fitted ladders may be used on vessels over 9 meters. A lifejacket and normal sea-going kit are required.\n\n#### 7.5 Age Requirements\n\nThe NSRI allows crew members aged 16 to 74 (up to 74 years and 365 days). Those older must self-insure and provide a specific letter stating this.\n\n#### 8. Training\n\nTraining occurs both ashore and at sea, but trainees are not allowed on rescue missions. The trainee period lasts a minimum of 6 months.\n\n- Trainees with proof of acceptable sea service on non-rescue vessels may count this time towards crew status, provided at least 20 hours are served on the largest vessel at their station.\n  \n- For service on multiple vessel classes, the required sea-time is: 20 hours for Class I and 30 hours for Class III; or 15 hours for Class II and 15 hours for Class III.\n  \n- The station commander may require additional hours for more practical experience before granting crew status.\n\nDespite prior sea-going experience, candidates must acclimate to NSRI protocols. Teamwork is crucial in rescue operations, and part of the training involves becoming familiar with the team. All sea-time must be documented on provided log sheets.\n\nNote: Sea-time as a trainee does not count towards qualifying sea-time for Coxswain certification by SAMSA.",

A Training Committee ensures that the highest training standards are met. The common purpose of all members is to save lives, making comprehensive training paramount.\n\n#### Expectations for Station Crew Members\n\nNSRI Rescue Stations are disciplined but not regimented. As a crew member, you are expected to conform to all station-specific and national requirements.\n\n- **At Sea**: The Coxswain's orders are law.\n- **Alcohol**: It is prohibited to carry or consume alcohol aboard any NSRI rescue craft or vessel, or when in uniform.\n- **Public Perception**: The public judges our conduct and appearance, often holding us in high esteem.\n- **Maintenance and Cleaning**: Alongside the excitement of sea rescues, regular maintenance and cleaning routines are essential.\n- **Attitude**: Enthusiasm and self-motivation are crucial.\n\n#### Confidentiality\n\nDuring NSRI duties, you may encounter confidential information. It is crucial not to divulge details of operations to the media or others, nor should you express personal opinions on operations. Media inquiries should be directed to the station commander or media liaison officer (082 3803800).\n\n#### Duty\n\nThe duty period typically lasts one week, depending on station policies, with off-duty periods varying based on crew numbers. During duty, crew members must respond to SMS or WhatsApp call-out systems, ensuring they are fit and ready for duty at any time during the week. The duty crew also practices at sea and performs maintenance work on the station during their duty week.",

Solids, such as a wooden block, may be difficult to ignite, but broken down into wood shavings, these burn very easily. A piece of paper can start a major fire. When heat is applied to paper, it produces vapours, which ignite, in turn producing more heat. Solid fuels may require an external source of heat to raise them to a temperature to give off flammable vapours.\n\nThere are many flammable liquids that produce vapours. An empty petrol tank is more dangerous than a full one, as it will contain flammable vapour. Gases are existing vapours, which can ignite instantly. Some gases are lighter than air, others heavier. If gas can be smelt, it indicates that there is already a substantial amount present, and due care must be exercised.\n\n#### 5.1.2 Oxygen\n\nJust as the human body requires oxygen to survive, so does fire, and 21% of air is oxygen.\n\n#### 5.1.3 Heat\n\nThis is the source that is required to bring the article to, and maintain, a minimum temperature causing ignition, i.e., sparks, an open flame, friction, etc. A critical temperature must be reached for ignition to take place, but once a fire has started it will generally maintain its supply of heat. Heat can be applied in any number of ways. It may be deliberate (arson), or it could be accidental, for example, fuel or oil coming into contact with a very hot surface, a heater placed too close to furnishings or paper, or power points being overloaded causing wiring to overheat. Also, blocked cooling vents or air inlets can result in machinery overheating and becoming a fire risk.\n\nThe above three elements combined is commonly known as the Triangle of Combustion.",

On the larger boats, water pumps will enable fire hoses to be used.\n\nRemember, however, that water must never be sprayed on a liquid fuel fire as it could result in spreading the fire. The only exception is if a very fine mist spray is produced with a high water pressure nozzle.\n\nAlso note that it will be difficult to extinguish a fire that is being fed with a supply of fuel. To isolate any possible flow of fuel out of the tanks, fuel shut-off valves are fitted to fuel tanks. Provision is made to operate them remotely.\n\nOn the larger vessels with engine rooms, means are provided to shut off all vents that supply air to the engine room should this be the seat of the fire. On such vessels, a fixed fire extinguishing system is also fitted to administer a smothering gas such as CO2.",

The controlling method (operating instructions).\n\nThe extinguisher should also have a service label indicating:\n\n1. The date of service.\n2. The name of the technician.\n3. The serial number of the technician.\n\nRegulations require one 1.5kg dry powder extinguisher per motor. On larger vessels with multiple compartments, there should be one extinguisher in each compartment. Fire extinguishers must be serviced annually by a SAMSA accredited (Dotfas) dealer. Small fire extinguishers have an average discharge time of only about 20 seconds, so it is important to direct the jet of the extinguisher close to the base of the fire.\n\n#### Immediate Steps in the Event of a Fire\n\n- Turn the vessel so that smoke blows away, downwind, and clear of the vessel.\n- Stop the engine and disconnect the fuel lines or operate remote fuel shut-off valves.\n- Direct the fire extinguisher discharge at the base of the flame or smother with wet clothing.\n- If in the engine room, close all vents and operate the gas smothering valves.\n\n![Fire Extinguisher](images/Pre-sea_Training_Course_Notes_p1_img1.jpeg)",

Due to the thick steel cylinder required to contain the pressure of 0.53 bar, the extinguisher is expensive.\n2. CO2 has a very short \u201cthrow\u201d and the operator has to be close to the fire, which may be impossible in the case of very hot fires.\n3. Could be detrimental to very delicate equipment.\n\n#### Dry Powder Extinguisher (Dry Chemical Powder or DCP) \u2013 Blue Label\n\n![Dry powder based extinguisher](images/Pre-sea_Training_Course_Notes_p17_img2.jpeg)\n\n- Can be used on virtually all classes of fires. The \u201call purpose\u201d dry powder is better in extinguishing fires than \u201cstandard\u201d powder and is much better in preventing flash-back of fires. However, it is more expensive.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n1. Is effective on most classes of fire (especially the all-purpose powder).\n2. Powder has a long throw and acts as a protective shield against the heat.\n3. Emission of the powder can be controlled for approximately half an hour after first operating the extinguisher.\n4. The 4.5 kg extinguisher is light enough for a slightly built person to use.",

To use a hand flare, refer to the instructions for the brand used on board your vessel.\n\n**Projectile Flare Set (Pencil Flares):**\n\nThis consists of a launcher and six flares. To use a projectile flare:\n\n1. Unscrew container.\n2. Remove cover and screw launcher into exposed thread.\n3. Aim vertically away from body, retract button fully and release.\n\nOrange smoke generators cannot be used at night. They are very effective for daytime detection by search aircraft, but a very strong wind can quickly disperse the smoke. To use an orange smoke generator, refer to instructions for the brand used on board your vessel.\n\nShould a rocket or flare fail to ignite, wait a few seconds and then lower it carefully into the water, and let it go. Do not examine a pyrotechnic that has failed to ignite. A rocket or flare once activated must be regarded as very dangerous.\n\n#### 6.1 Time-expired Pyrotechnics\n\nRockets, flares, and smoke markers have the actual date of manufacture and the date of expiry marked on the container. They usually have a safe life span of three years from the date of manufacture. After this, chemical changes start taking place that render them unstable. They can be dangerous and must never be fired.

Use the radio to call for assistance.  \n15. Obtain particulars of the other vessel, including the name of the vessel, port of registry, name of master, destination, and nature of damage sustained.  \n16. Ensure that all details are well documented in the logbook and that the position of the collision is plotted on the chart.\n\n#### Grounding Procedures\n\n1. Account for all persons aboard.  \n2. Ascertain if anyone has been injured, and if necessary, remove them to a place of safety and attend to injuries. Close and secure all watertight doors and hatches.  \n3. Prepare lifesaving equipment and don life jackets.  \n4. Carry out damage assessment.  \n5. If aground on a shelving bottom and the vessel is being pushed further ashore (especially on a rising tide), drop anchor to keep the bow into the surf and reduce the rate of onshore drift.  \n6. Check for ingress of water and start pumps if necessary.  \n7. If the vessel is aground on an obstruction, check the surroundings to ascertain where she is being \"held.\" Do not force the vessel off the obstruction with the motors, as this may exacerbate damage or start a leak. On a rising tide, it may be possible to get her off without further damage by trimming the vessel.  \n8. Call for assistance.  \n9. Check fuel tanks for damage and isolate if necessary to prevent contaminated fuel from being fed to the engines.",

If the situation looks hopeless and the shore is reasonably close, get a line ashore with a buoy.\n\n11. If no one is standing by ashore and it is obvious that the vessel is too unstable to stay aboard, ask for a volunteer to swim a line ashore. This will be of great assistance to the weaker swimmers or the injured, or a guide line for the life raft.\n\n#### 10.3 Fire\n\n1. Do a headcount to ensure that all crew are accounted for.\n2. Make sure that no one is still in the area of the fire.\n3. Don life jackets.\n4. Stop the engine(s), operate the remote control or manual fuel shut-off cocks.\n5. Close and secure all watertight doors and hatches.\n6. Use the fire extinguisher by directing the jet at the base of the fire.\n7.

Prepare lifesaving equipment for use. Where necessary, remove life rafts and pyrotechnics away from the proximity of the fire.\n9. Use radio or cell phone to call for assistance.\n10. Isolate any electrical circuits in the area of the fire.\n11. If you are not able to get the fire out, prepare your crew to enter the water.\n\n#### 10.4 Capsize\n\n1. Do a headcount to ensure that all crew are accounted for and that there are no injuries.\n2. If anyone is missing, check under the boat if it is safe to do so.\n3.

Collect the lifejackets and ensure that everyone is wearing one.\n2. Salvage any floating equipment.\n3. Retrieve the capsize kit.\n4. Attempt to get everyone out of the water and onto the upturned bottom. To this end, rig a line from the motor legs to the bow eye for a hand-hold.\n5. Attempt to keep survivors on the hull well covered to prevent hypothermia.\n6. Stream the sea anchor unless drifting towards the shore.\n7. Swimming for the shore could be a fatal decision. Stay with the boat. Carefully weigh the options.\n8. Use flares judiciously. Do not waste them.\n9. Display the ID sheet.\n\nIt is possible to right a small craft using the body weight of one or two crew. A line must be secured to the gunwale on one side of the vessel and led over the capsized bottom to the other side. Using the rope as a support, the crew person climbs onto the underside of the gunwale opposite, to stand or kneel, and then lean over backwards to pull the boat over. The drogue line would be ideal for this purpose. If the capsize has taken place in the surf line, keep the bow into the surf. If it is the intention to right the craft, then attempt to swim it out of the surf first. Submersion in sea water can result in damage to the outboard motor/s, especially if they were operating at the time. Even greater damage can be caused if sand gets in. It is important to try and right the vessel before it gets into the \u201cshore dump\u201d.",

It will be needed to activate the inflation process, and to prevent the inflated life raft drifting away before it can be boarded.\n- Always check the water surface before throwing the life raft canister/satchel overboard. There may be persons already in the water below.\n- Do not jump into the inflated life raft from a height. You could injure someone already aboard, or damage the life raft. If you cannot step into the life raft (after removing your shoes), then you will have to jump into the water first, and then board.\n- When all persons are on board, release or cut the painter.\n- Deploy the sea anchor to minimise drift.\n- Close the entrance.\n- Take anti sea-sick tablets.\n- Bale out any water, and endeavour to keep the interior dry.\n\n![Life Raft Deployment](images/Pre-sea_Training_Course_Notes_p1_img1.jpeg)\n\nFor more information, visit [www.searescue.org.za](http://www.searescue.org.za) or contact via email at [bretta@searescue.org.za](mailto:bretta@searescue.org.za).",

This is achieved by always adhering to safe working practices and carrying out the correct procedures as laid down by the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and in your training. Whenever in doubt, ask your Coxswain.\n\nRules and regulations are there for a reason. Always obey them. Learn to find the reasoning behind them, and share them with your fellow trainees.

This can cause Rope Burn.\n- Wrap rope around your wrist in order to get a better grip - it will not release quickly enough if needed, causing injury, or pulling you overboard.\n- Handle a wire rope without gloves being worn (a broken wire in the strand could impale your hand).\n- Hold the nozzle of a discharging CO2 fire extinguisher - it can freeze, causing Freeze Burn.\n- Touch any part of the antenna of a MF/HF radio installation. This can cause Radiation Burn due to the emission of microwave energy. Do not stand near the antenna if transmitting is possible.\n- Wear loose fitted clothing (sleeves, ties, and belts) near turning sheaves or moving machinery (fan belts, flywheels, shafts, etc.). Keep long hair tied back and away.\n\n#### 2.2 Do\n\n- Always have one hand for the boat and one hand for yourself to support you.

It identifies you as NSRI crew, instilling confidence in yourself, as well as those you are going to rescue. Like any PPE, it needs to be worn properly to work properly, and used correctly to be fully effective. PPE is bulky and uncomfortable at first, but with time - this gets better and the benefits outweigh the negatives.\n\nA big part of what we try to achieve as Sea Rescue is to set an example to the general boating public as to water safety. This is why we wear lifejackets on the water at all times.\n\n#### Lifejackets\n\nNSRI have two styles of lifejacket: auto-inflate and foam-filled. Class 1 vessels have auto-inflate lifejackets, whereas smaller vessels have foam-filled jackets (120 - 150N buoyancy). Auto-inflate lifejackets will inflate when in the water and have 150N of buoyancy. Once inflated, there is a mouthpiece for manual inflating and, in some lifejackets, a spray hood.\n\n**Spray Hoods:**\n\n- Prevent inhalation of spray, particularly as hypothermia sets in.\n- Reduce heat loss from head.\n- Greatly increase survival time.\n\n**Crotch Straps:**\n\n- Prevent lifejacket from riding up.\n- Must be adjusted properly to be able to swim effectively (test by lifting arms up first).\n\n![NSRI Crew with PPE](images/Pre-sea_Training_Course_Notes_p1_img1.jpeg)\n\n---\n\nFor more information, visit [www.searescue.org.za](http://www.searescue.org.za) or contact via email at [bretta@searescue.org.za](mailto:bretta@searescue.org.za).",

Decision Making in Rescue Situations\n\n- **Assess Hazards**: Determine whether to proceed with a rescue based on potential risks. If the risks are too high, it may be safer not to attempt a rescue to avoid increasing the number of victims.\n- **Preparation Before Entering Water**: If a rescue is necessary, take precautions to ensure safety and success:\n  - **Exposure Protection**: Use a wetsuit for cold water and rocky environments.\n  - **Buoyancy**: Equip yourself with a torpedo buoy or other buoyancy aids for the victim.\n  - **Propulsion**: Use fins for better movement in water.\n  - **Additional Gear**: Consider using a helmet, mask, knife, swimmer's line, and cow tail.\n  - **Assign Spotters**: Have spotters look for the victim and bystanders call for assistance.\n\n#### 6.2 Victim Psychology\n\n- **Behavior in Water**: Victims aim to get as much of their body out of the water as possible, often in a state of panic.\n- **Perception of Rescuers**: In panic, victims may see rescuers as platforms rather than people, using them to escape the water.\n- **Safety Strategy**: By going underwater, rescuers can avoid being used as a platform. Once control is established, victims usually calm down, but it's crucial to prevent water from entering their airway to avoid further panic.\n\n#### 6.3 In-Water Rescue Techniques\n\n- **Using a Torpedo Buoy**: \n  - Attach the buoy to yourself with a strop over one shoulder and across the chest.\n  - Reassure the casualty verbally and give them the buoy to hold with both hands.\n  - Tow the casualty to safety, encouraging them to kick to assist.\n- **Without a Torpedo Buoy**:\n  - Approach with caution, as panicked swimmers can be dangerous.\n  - Communicate clearly with the casualty, reassuring them and explaining your intentions.",

        "content": "### Rescue Procedures and Lookout Duties\n\nWhen taking a casualty aboard out of the water, the best place to board the craft will depend on its size and prevailing conditions. The bow is not the best place for this, and the stern on the rigid inflatable and smaller craft is dangerous due to the proximity of the propellers. On these craft, the best place will be amidships and far enough forward to ensure the casualty's legs, which tend to drift under the craft, are safe.\n\nLarger craft have transom platforms over the stern, and in this case, the propellers are well forward under the counter. Even with low freeboard craft, it is very difficult to board from the water, even in the case of a swimmer who is mobile. In this instance, a bight (loop) of rope secured over the side can make a useful step.\n\nAlways try to bring the casualty aboard in a horizontal position, making use of a Stokes Basket, Trauma Board, or any other means available if spinal injury or hypothermia is suspected.\n\n#### Duties of a Lookout\n\nBeing a lookout happens at three distinct stages:\n\n1. When underway at sea generally.\n2. When at anchor during anchor watch.\n3. When conducting a search for a missing person/vessel.\n\nIt is a legal requirement for all vessels at sea to keep a proper visual lookout at all times. The lookout shall methodically sweep the horizon and bring to the attention of the helmsman or coxswain any object or sighting that could affect the safety of the vessel or be associated with the SAR operation.\n\nWhen doing a specific search, the lookouts should be allocated a 30-45\u00b0 \"sector\" to search, rather than an entire side, for more focused searching. Such sightings must be reported in terms of degrees on the relative bow, and the eyes must never be taken \"off the spot\" until the bearing has been taken.\n\nThe terms \"red\" and \"green,\" corresponding to the color of the navigation lights, can also be used to indicate on what side of the bow the sighting has taken place. Another system that can be used is the clock system - with 12 o'clock being dead ahead, and 6 o'clock being aft. The corresponding time is the direction that should be searched.\n\n---\n\n![Sea Rescue](images/Pre-sea_Training_Course_Notes_p1_img1.jpeg)\n\n---\n\nFor more information, visit [www.searescue.org.za](http://www.searescue.org.za) or contact via email at [bretta@searescue.org.za](mailto:bretta@searescue.org.za).",

When binoculars are being used, the \"sweep\u201d must be taken very slowly because they have a very narrow field of vision, and time must be allowed for small objects to come into view from between the troughs of large swells.\n\nWhen at anchor, two transit bearings should be taken at approximately 90\u00b0 and regularly checked to make sure the anchor is holding. In addition, an alarm can be set on the GPS, so that if the vessel drifts out of a particular zone, it will sound.\n\n#### Man Overboard\n\nUsing the \"Buddy system\u201d at sea will help prevent any member of the crew from falling overboard, such as when a seasick person is leaning over the side to vomit.\n\n- If you should see someone falling overboard, or should you observe someone in the water, shout \"MAN OVERBOARD\u201d and state which side. DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THAT PERSON - NOT EVEN MOMENTARILY. Point in the direction of the MOB.\n- It is very easy to lose sight of someone in the water, especially if the sea is rough.\n- Mark the position of the casualty with a life ring preferably with a self-igniting light.\n- Some vessels have a Dan Buoy or life ring on the bulwarks/rails for this purpose. If this is not at hand, then a lifejacket or a fender or anything else that floats will do.\n- At night, the searchlight must be used to mark the MOB and/or the marker, and all available eyes assist in watching.\n- Push the \"Man Overboard\u201d (MOB) facility on the GPS to record the position.\n- Where the casualty is lost to sight, lookouts should be posted as high up as possible, and at night, every possible light should be used, and white illuminating parachute flares released to assist observation.\n- Depending on the amount of lookouts, the area around the vessel should be divided into sectors and each sector allocated to a lookout.\n- During the search, all on-board noise must be kept to a minimum, and ears made available for listening to whistle sounds. Consider turning off the engines to make listening easier, if conditions allow.\n- Watch the GPS display screen to see if the AIS MOB signal is activated by the MOB, giving the position (if AIS fitted to the boat, and if the lifejackets are equipped with AIS MOB's).",
